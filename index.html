    <h1>Chord Lookup Project</h1>
    <p>
        These are some tools I made for myself to help me practice. They are not finished products and they are buggy. But I wanted to practice more than I wanted to do a good job on these.
        I'm sure some version of these must exist out there as apps but I either couldn't find exactly what I wanted or I didn't want to pay.
    </p>

    <p>This project contains 2 webpages:</p>

    <h2><a href="./chord_lookup.html">Chord Lookup</a></h2>
    <p>Type a jazz chord into the search bar and submit should generate an info card with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the chord name that was input</li>
        <li>the chord name it was translated to internally</li>
        <li>some rootless piano voicings</li>
        <li>the analogous ionian key</li>
        <li>the scale</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All with very dubious spelling.</p>

    <h2><a href="./exercise_gen.html">Exercise Gen</a></h2>
    <p>
        This generates 20 jazz chord names at a time and 4 random scale degrees.
        The point of this is to follow along in a notebook to practice being able to recall scale values for chords.
        There is no answer key/source of truth for this. This definitely could/should be synergized with Chord Lookup
        to generate the actual scale values from the degrees.
