Chord Lookup Project
=====================
These are some tools I made for myself to help me practice. They are not finished products and they are buggy. But I wanted to practice more than I wanted to do a good job on these.
I'm sure some version of these must exist out there as apps but I either couldn't find exactly what I wanted or I didn't want to pay.

This project contains 2 webpages:

Chord Lookup
=====================
Type a jazz chord into the search bar and submit should generate an info card with:
  - the chord name that was input
  - the chord name it was translated to internally
  - some rootless piano voicings
  - the analagous ionian key
  - the scale

All with very dubious spelling.

Exercise Gen
=====================
This generates 20 jazz chord names at a time and 4 random scale degrees. The point of this is to follow along in a notebook to practice being able to recall scale values for chords. There is no answer key/source of truth for this. This definitely could/should be synergized with Chord Lookup to generate the actual scale values from the degrees.
